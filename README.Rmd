  Functions to analyse time series consisting of low counts are provided. The 
  focus in the current version is on practical models that can  capture first 
  and higher-order dependence based on the work of Joe (1996). Both equidispersed 
  and overdispersed marginal distributions of data can be modelled. Regression 
  effects can be included. Fast and efficient procedures for likelihood based 
  inference and probabilistic forecasting are provided as well as useful tools 
  for model validation and diagnostics.

## Details
The package allows simulation of convolution-closed count time series models with the \code{\link{cocoSim}}
function. Model fitting is performed with the \code{\link{cocoReg}} routine. By passing a cocoReg-type object, the S3 method \code{predict} computes  k-step ahead forecasting distributions.  \code{\link{cocoBoot}}, \code{\link{cocoPit}}, \code{\link{cocoScore}}, \code{\link{cocoSoc}} and \code{\link{cocoResid}} provide routines for model assessment. The main usage of the package is illustrated within the \code{\link{cocoReg}} function section. For more details
and examples of the functions see the respective sections within this vignette. 

By default, our functions make use of an RCPP implementation. However, users
with a running Julia installation can choose to call Julia in the background
to run their functions by specifying it in the R function input. This option
is particularly useful for the regression (\code{\link{cocoReg}}), where a complex likelihood function
must be numerically evaluated to obtain parameter estimates. By leveraging
Julia's automatic differentiation capabilities,
our functions can take advantage of numerical gradients,
leading to increased numerical stability and faster convergence.

Despite these advantages, we found that both the \proglang{julia} and RCPP
implementations produced qualitatively similar results in all our tests.
As a result, we have decided to use the RCPP implementation as
the default option to make our package accessible to non-julia users.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of coconots from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("coconots")
```

or the latest version from GitHub with:
``` r
devtools::install_github("manuhuth/coconots")
```

## Example using RCPP implementation

Coconots runs on an RCPP and a \proglang{julia} implementation. RCPP is the default. The regression results can be summarized using the \code{summary} function.

```{r example, echo=TRUE}
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.4, 0.2)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 1, type = "GP", par = pars,
                length = length)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 1, type = "GP", data = data)
summary(coco)
```

## Example using \proglang{julia} implementation

In order to use the \proglang{julia} functions, you need a running version of \proglang{julia} installed. You need to install the relevant \proglang{julia} packages only once.    

```{r example_julia_installation, echo=TRUE}
coconots::installJuliaPackages()
```

If installed, the \proglang{julia} implementation can be addressed by setting the \proglang{julia} argument to true. In this case we need to set the seed within the simulation function in order to pass it to \proglang{julia}.

```{r example_julia_, echo=TRUE}
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.3, 0.01, 0.2)
data <- cocoSim(order = 2, type = "Poisson", par = pars, length = length,
                julia = TRUE, julia_seed = 123)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 2, type = "Poisson", data = data, julia = TRUE)
```

## Model assessment
We provide different tools for model assessment. One can even use the RCPP implementation for the regression and do model assessment using the \proglang{julia} implementation. If this is desired, one needs to specify in the output of the regression that it should be \proglang{julia} compatible. Note that this is not necessary if the \proglang{julia} option in the regression is true.
```{r example_assessment, echo=TRUE}
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.4)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 1, type = "Poisson", par = pars, length = length)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 1, type = "Poisson", data = data,
                julia_installed=TRUE)
(scores <- cocoScore(coco, julia = TRUE))
pit <- cocoPit(coco, julia = TRUE)
plot(pit)
boot <- cocoBoot(coco, julia = TRUE)
plot(boot)
forecast <- predict(coco, k=3, julia = TRUE)
plot(forecast) #plot all k forecasts
plot(forecast[[1]]) #plot density of one-step ahead forecast
resid <- cocoResid(coco)
plot(resid)
```

## Compare Models
Model selection is facilitated by providing quick and easy access to the scoring metrics. 
```{r compare_models, echo=TRUE}
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1.3, 0.25, 0.03, 0.2, 0.3)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 2, type = "GP", par = pars, length = length)
soc <- cocoSoc(data, julia=T)
summary(soc)
```
