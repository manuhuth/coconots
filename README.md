Functions to analyse time series consisting of low counts are provided.
The focus in the current version is on practical models that can capture
first and higher-order dependence based on the work of Joe (1996). Both
equidispersed and overdispersed marginal distributions of data can be
modelled. Regression effects can be included. Fast and efficient
procedures for likelihood based inference and probabilistic forecasting
are provided as well as useful tools for model validation and
diagnostics.

## Details

The package allows simulation of convolution-closed count time series
models with the cocoSim function. Model fitting is performed with the
cocoReg routine. By passing a cocoReg-type object, cocoForecast computes
the one-step ahead forecasting distribution. cocoBoot, cocoPit,
cocoScore, and cocoResid provide routines for model assessment. The main
usage of the package is illustrated within the cocoReg function chapter.
For more details and examples of the functions see the respective
sections within this vignette.

By default, our functions make use of an RCPP implementation. However,
users with a running Julia installation can choose to call Julia in the
background to run their functions by specifying it in the R function
input. This option is particularly useful for the regression (), where a
complex likelihood function must be numerically evaluated to obtain
parameter estimates. By leveraging Juliaâ€™s automatic differentiation
capabilities, our functions can take advantage of numerical gradients,
leading to increased numerical stability and faster convergence.

Despite these advantages, we found that both the Julia and RCPP
implementations produced qualitatively similar results in all our tests.
As a result, we have decided to use the RCPP implementation as the
default option to make our package accessible to non-Julia users.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of coconots from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("coconots")
```

or the latest version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("manuhuth/coconots")
```

## Example using RCPP implementation

Coconots runs on an RCPP and a Julia implementation. RCPP is the
default. The regression results can be summarized using the summary
function.

``` r
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.4, 0.2)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 1, type = "GP", par = pars,
                length = length)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 1, type = "GP", data = data)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':
#>   method            from
#>   as.zoo.data.frame zoo
summary(coco)
#> Coefficients:
#>          Estimate   Std. Error         t
#> lambda     1.0548       0.0930   11.3367
#> alpha      0.4201       0.0373   11.2508
#> eta        0.1609       0.0329    4.8958
#> 
#> Type: GP 
#> Order: 1 
#> 
#> Log-likelihood: -885.012
```

## Example using Julia implementation

In order to use the Julia functions, you need a running version of Julia
installed. You need to install the relevant Julia packages once.

``` r
coconots::installJuliaPackages()
#> Starting Julia ...
```

If installed, the Julia implementation can be addressed by setting the
julia argument to true. In this case we need to set the seed within the
simulation function in order to pass it to Julia.

``` r
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.3, 0.01, 0.2)
data <- cocoSim(order = 2, type = "Poisson", par = pars, length = length,
                julia = TRUE, julia_seed = 123)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 2, type = "Poisson", data = data, julia = TRUE)
```

## Model assessment

We provide different tools for model assessment. One can even use the
RCPP implementation for the regression and do model assessment with the
Julia implementation. If this is desired, one needs to specify in the
output of the regression that it should be Julia compatible. Note that
this is not necessary if the Julia option in the regression is true.

``` r
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1, 0.4)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 1, type = "Poisson", par = pars, length = length)
coco <- cocoReg(order = 1, type = "Poisson", data = data,
                julia_installed=TRUE)
(scores <- cocoScore(coco, julia = TRUE))
#> $log.score
#> [1] 1.501935
#> 
#> $quad.score
#> [1] -0.2532058
#> 
#> $rps.score
#> [1] 0.619761
pit <- cocoPit(coco, julia = TRUE)
plot(pit)
```

## Compare Models

Model selection is facilitated by providing quick and easy access to the
scoring metrics.

``` r
library(coconots)
length <- 500

pars <- c(1.3, 0.25, 0.03, 0.2, 0.3)
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 2, type = "GP", par = pars, length = length)
varsoc <- cocoVarsoc(data, julia=T)
#> [1] "Computing PAR1 model."
#> [1] "Computing PAR2 model."
#> [1] "Computing GP1 model."
#> [1] "Computing GP2 model."
summary(varsoc)
#>            Logarithmic Score   Quadratic Score   Ranked Probability Score
#> 1   PAR1            2.265970        -0.1221436                   1.302572
#> 2   PAR2            2.264753        -0.1223451                   1.301770
