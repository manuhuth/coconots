\title{Probability Integral Transform Based Model Assessment Procedure}
\usage{
cocoPit(coco, J = 10, conf.alpha = 0.05, julia = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coco}{An object of class coco}

\item{J}{Number of bins for the histogram (default: 10)}

\item{conf.alpha}{Confidence level for the confidence bands.}

\item{julia}{if TRUE, the PIT is computed with Julia.}
}
\value{
an object of class cocoPit. It contains the probability integral
transform values, its p-values and information on the model specifications.
}
\description{
Computes the probability integral transform (PIT) and provides
the non-randomized PIT histogram for assessing absolute performance of a
fitted model as proposed by Czado et al. (2009).
}
\details{
The adequacy of a distributional assumption for a model is assessed by
checking the cumulative non-randomized PIT distribution for uniformity.
A useful graphical device is the PIT histogram, which displays this
distribution to J equally spaced bins. We supplement the graph by
incorporating approximately \eqn{100(1 - \alpha)\%} confidence intervals obtained
from a standard chi-square goodness-of-fit test of the null hypothesis that
the J bins of the histogram are drawn from a uniform distribution.
For details, see Jung, McCabe and Tremayne (2016).

lambda <- 1
alpha <- 0.4
set.seed(12345)
data <- cocoSim(order = 1, type = "Poisson", par = c(lambda, alpha), length = 100)
#julia_installed = TRUE ensures that the fit object
#is compatible with the julia cocoPit implementation 
fit <- cocoReg(order = 1, type = "Poisson", data = data)

#PIT R implementation
pit_r <- cocoPit(fit)
